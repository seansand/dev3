Sean says:

Replaced gradle cache of groovy-all-1.8.6.jar with version from 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19611093/groovy-servlet-on-app-engine
in order to get around a groovy bug:


java.security.AccessControlException: access denied ("java.lang.RuntimePermission" "accessClassInPackage.sun.reflect")

for basically all groovy classes.


A Spock error is still happening at build test time but Gradle still builds it.

The jar is labeled 1.8.6 but it is really the newer 2.1.10 version with the name changed.
