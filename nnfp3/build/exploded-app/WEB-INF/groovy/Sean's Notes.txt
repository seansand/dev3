In version nnfp2

Replaced gradle cache of groovy-all-1.8.6.jar with version from 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19611093/groovy-servlet-on-app-engine
in order to get around a groovy bug:


java.security.AccessControlException: access denied ("java.lang.RuntimePermission" "accessClassInPackage.sun.reflect")

for basically all groovy classes.


In version nnfp3

A validation error is still happening at build test time but Gradle still builds it.
