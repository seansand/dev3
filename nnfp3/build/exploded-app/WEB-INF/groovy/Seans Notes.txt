As of July 2016 you can't build new version (which is in HG) due to Google upgrading to OAuth 2.0.

Need to figure out how to do this.

https://www.google.com/accounts/ClientLogin (gives 404)
https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/AuthForInstalledApps
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/deprecations/


This was solved by simply updating to the latest SDK (1.9.38).

In version nnfp2

Replaced gradle cache of groovy-all-1.8.6.jar with version from 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19611093/groovy-servlet-on-app-engine
in order to get around a groovy bug:


java.security.AccessControlException: access denied ("java.lang.RuntimePermission" "accessClassInPackage.sun.reflect")

for basically all groovy classes.


In version nnfp3

A validation error is still happening at build test time but Gradle still builds it.
